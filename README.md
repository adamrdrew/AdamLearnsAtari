# Adam Learns Atari 2600 Programming
This repo is me working through learning to program for the Atari VCS aka the 2600. The files are numbered to show the progression of what I am learning. This README will eventually include links to resources I'm using and stuff I've learned.

All the disclaimers. I'm just Some Guy and don't know nothin'. This code is all terrible and bad. Its full of mistakes that I don't even know are there. But who cares? Its 2600 programming. 

## Tools
I'm using the excellend [Atari Dev Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chunkypixel.atari-dev-studio) plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It comes with an emulator, assembler, sprite editor, and code sense for 6502 assembly. It's completely awesome and makes this whole what-have-you easier than it should be. If you install that you can do the thing too. You can also just install [DASM](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/) and [Stella](https://stella-emu.github.io/) and do the thing that way.

*Note: I couldn't get the DASM that comes with Atari Dev Studio to work. It couldn't find the header files that come with DASM for 2600 in its path. I ended up downloading DASM and just pointing ADS to it.*
